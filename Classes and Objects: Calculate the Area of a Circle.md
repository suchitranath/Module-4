# EX.NO:4(A) Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## Program
```
import math class
cse():
  def mech(Self,num):
      a=math.pi*num*num print(f"Area of circle: {a:.2f}")
r=int(input())
obj=cse()
obj.mech(r)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
